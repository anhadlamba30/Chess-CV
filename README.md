# Chess-CV

Overview
This web application utilizes Machine Learning (ML) to recognize and reconstruct a chessboard from a given image or upload. Users can interact with the reconstructed chessboard, making moves and exploring chess strategies.
Features
Chessboard Detection: Uses ML algorithms to identify the chessboard within an image.
Chessboard Reconstruction: Converts the detected chessboard into a digital representation.
Interactive Chessboard: Allows users to make moves and interact with the chessboard.
Chess Logic Integration: Utilizes existing chess libraries for game mechanics and move validation.
Technologies Used
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (with TensorFlow.js and OpenCV.js)
Backend: Node.js (with Express.js)
Machine Learning: TensorFlow.js and OpenCV.js
Chess Libraries: Python-Chess or Chess.js

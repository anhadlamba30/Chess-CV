# Chess-CV

## Overview

This web application utilizes Machine Learning (ML) to recognize and reconstruct a chessboard from a given image or upload. Users can interact with the reconstructed chessboard, making moves and exploring chess strategies.

## Features

*   **Chessboard Detection**: Uses ML algorithms to identify the chessboard within an image.
*   **Chessboard Reconstruction**: Converts the detected chessboard into a digital representation.
*   **Interactive Chessboard**: Allows users to make moves and interact with the chessboard.
*   **Chess Logic Integration**: Utilizes existing chess libraries for game mechanics and move validation.

## Technologies Used

*   **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (with TensorFlow.js and OpenCV.js)
*   **Backend**: Node.js (with Express.js)
*   **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow.js and OpenCV.js
*   **Chess Libraries**: Python-Chess or Chess.js
